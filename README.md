# Manchester-Metrolink

No easy way to quickly find out when the next tram is from your stop without actually physically going there?
Want to know if you should bring a jacket with you?

This will let you search the Greater Manchester Metrolink tram stops to let you search the different tram stops, return the next 3 trams to that stop and where they're going.

The Metrolink API response can be a bit delayed so bare that in mind

It will also tell you weather for the destination.

Utilises the metrolink API & OpenWeather API
